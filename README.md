The discussions for building this app are [here](https://upai.zulipchat.com/).


## Development

To run the webserver, run the Django local server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The frontend is built using SolidJS. To run the development server with
hot-reloading, run the webpack dev server:

```bash
yarn run dev
```
